# MQTT Browser

This project aims to provide a browsable view of the messages passing through an MQTT broker. This is similar to http://test-mosquitto.heroku.com/ but more flexible.

It will be deployed as soon as it is in a working and vaguely secure state.

## Requirements

MQTT Browser requires node.js, all modules required are preinstalled
